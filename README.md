# Lighthouse Labs | Test Driven Development with Mocha and Chai

* [ ] Test-Driven Development
* [ ] Assertions (console and NodeJS assert)
* [ ] CommonJS Modules
* [ ] npm
* [ ] Test Runners
* [ ] Assertion Libraries
## Brainstorm Ways we can Improve Code Quality

* Better Comments (comment your code!)
* Add more variables (describe your values!)
* Testing!!! - we can run tests and see if our code runs or outputs the expected results
* DRY code - reusable classes, functions, loops, don't repeat yourself!
* Proper indenting / white-space
* Error-handling - handle cases that could go-wrong
* Keep it simple!
* Following guidelines or code style guides

## Types of Testing?

* Unit Testing: writing tests on a per-function, per-code, per-component, per "unit."
* Manual Testing
  * `console.log()`
  * Just running our code and seeing if it works
* Functional Testing: running code against a set specification of requirements.
* Automated Testing: (could use a library) use of test-runners or testing suites to see if features are passing or failing

## Manual Testing

* Time-consuming
* Can require a lot of coding / knowledge
* Easy to make mistakes (esp. in repetition)
* Can be difficult to troubleshoot if you're not careful
* Tedious
* Flexible!
* Accuracy, precise, can hone in on whatever we'd like

## Automated Testing

* Very very fast
* Easier to test (re-test) large quantities of code
* Reusable / easily repeatable
* It's different than the code base (requires a bit of extra set-up)
* Consistent!
* If there is a mistake in a written test, this may result in a false positive/negative
* Easy to see if new changes have broken old code / functionality

## Test Driven Development

1. Write a test that confirms if a feature is running correctly.
2. Write code for the feature (run to confirm.)
3. If issues are encountered, address them.
4. Refactor (clean up the code.)

* Test suite can run experiments quickly and are easy to repeat
* This process forces us to think carefully about our features - what will indicate success or failure of the feature
