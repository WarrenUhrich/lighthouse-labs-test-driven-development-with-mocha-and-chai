## Brainstorm Ways we can Improve Code Quality

* Better Comments (comment your code!)
* Add more variables (describe your values!)
* Testing!!! - we can run tests and see if our code runs or outputs the expected results
* DRY code - reusable classes, functions, loops, don't repeat yourself!
* Proper indenting / white-space
* Error-handling - handle cases that could go-wrong
* Keep it simple!
* Following guidelines or code style guides
