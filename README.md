## Manual versus Automated

### Manual Testing

* Easier to set up and use
* Anyone can do it (though potentially to varying degrees depending on their understanding)
* Recording results is often inconsistent, esp. with multiple people
* During development, this is almost always employed to some degree

### Automated Testing

* Save money and time in the long-run
* Require time to setup
* Increased coverage
* Easily repeatable
* Result accuracy (removing some human)
* Encourages modularity
